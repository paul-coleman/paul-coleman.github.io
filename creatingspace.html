		<h1>Creating Space: Mandawuy Yunupingu’s both ways teaching as embodied by Yothu Yindi</h1>

		<div class="content">

			<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
			<p><em>Mandawuy Yunupingu used the both ways method of education to incorporate Yolngu cultural teachings alongside Western methods at Yirrkala school. Both ways teaching breaks down the hegemonic dominance of western discourse and places Indigenous epistemologies as equal. This paper looks at the both ways methodology as used in Yunupingu’s rock group Yothu Yindi to raise the platform of Yolngu culture to a mainstream audience. By placing Indigenous modes of thinking in a mainstream spot light, the Yothu Yindi create a space for Indigenous people to take ownership of their cultural identity.</em></p>
			<h3><b>Introduction: Mandawuy Yunupingu and the both ways method</b></h3>
			<p>Yothu Yindi blended traditional Yolngu concepts and elements with a Western popular music style. This created an embodied example of the both ways teaching method championed by band leader Mandawuy Yunupingu during his time at the Yirrkala School in north east Arnhem Land. This mixing of cultural foundations helped the band raise widespread public awareness of Yolngu culture and the contemporary Indigenous struggle. Yunupingu was integral in developing the both ways model of education to incorporate the ‘[double] power to operate in and negotiate between two cultures’ (Yunupingu 1999, p. 1). The teaching style was an attempt to continue teaching children their Yolngu culture alongside Western teaching methods in order to allow Yolngu people to operate between both the Yolngu world and the Western world. The aim being to take control of the curriculum in order to have Yolngu voices in control of Yolngu future (ibid). This paper will explain the philosophical underpinnings of the both ways method and discuss how Yunupingu used the methodology of both ways in his band Yothu Yindi to raise Yolngu culture and Indigenous rights issues to a mainstream audience as a tactic of cultural self determination.</p>
			<h3><b>Both ways: breaking down dominant modes of thinking</b></h3>
			<p>Both ways is a mingling current, <em>ganma</em> in the <em>Yolngu-matha</em> (language), a meeting of fresh water and salt water; ‘an area within the mangroves where the saltwater (non-Aborignal knowledge) coming in from the sea meets the stream of fresh water (Yolnu knowledge) coming down from the land’ (Marika 2000, p. 47). It refers to the mingling currents of Indigenous cultural teaching methods with Western ones. Children are taught their traditional culture, in traditional ways as well as in a mainstream Western way (Yunupingu 1999; Marika 2000). An important distinction between teaching about Indigenous culture and teaching Indigenous culture is made by Bat, Kilgariff and Doe (2014 p. 878) who note: ‘both ways means more than just adding in Indigenous knowledges to the content of a course, it means engaging with the learner’s own knowledges and ways of learning so the Indigenous identity is strengthened’. By actively engaging with and encouraging Indigenous modes of teaching, the both ways method avoids the pitfalls of ‘Eurocentric epistemologies [reproducing] and [reaffirming] the cultural assumptions of ‘the world’ and the ‘real’ by the dominant group’ (Waller 2016, p. 790) a hegemonic position that views non-Eurocentric modes of thought as inferior (Connell 2014, p. 218). The work of Edward Said can be useful in understanding this distinction. Said’s work on Orientalism builds a framework that creates a binary between the Eurocentric Occident and the Oriental Other that assumes ‘the Orient and everything in it was, if not patently inferior to, then in need of corrective study by the West’ (Said 1979, p. 41). This opposition is built up and retained by the dominant power structures in order to remain in positions of superiority over the colonised Other. The importance of both ways learning is shifting the knowledge centre away from this Western-centric ‘point zero’ where ‘Other’ modes of knowledge are seen as ‘different from’ or ‘opposed to’ which implies inferiority. Instead, both ways opens a space in which the different knowledge bases can work side by side influencing each other on an equal footing.<br>
			The ‘both ways’ method of education creates a space in which Indigenous cultural practices are taught alongside and equal to Western teaching methods. While working at Yirrkala, Yunupingu aimed at incorporating Yolngu teaching into the Western curriculum as he noted the inherent power structures involved in school education and language. He writes: ‘issues to do with curriculum, teaching, learning and literacy are all about power […] we wanted the school to be a place which put together Balanda [non-Aboriginal person] and Yolngu learning to strengthen our culture’ (Yunupingu 1999, p. 3). Both-ways is a method of education that decolonises the curriculum and picks apart the power structures that presuppose Western methods of teaching over Indigenous ones. The both ways method strips back the power implied by Western hegemonic discourse by being an educational model that doesn’t presuppose a correct mode of thinking, but instead creates a space in which different, yet equally valid, education systems can interrelate and ‘[open] up exciting possibilities for new ways of expressing and new ways of knowing’ (Yunupingu 1999, p. 4).</p>
			<h3><b>Yothu Yindi: a case study in the both ways method</b></h3>
			<p>Both ways, used as a tool to resist the colonisation of knowledge and as a method to open space for creative and new ways to convey Indigenous identity, was used in Yothu Yindi’s music. Yothu Yindi’s music has been an important vehicle in raising awareness of Yolngu culture and, in a broader sense, of the struggle for Indigenous rights to be addressed by mainstream Australia. Corn (2009, p. 6) notes:
			<blockquote>And so with its mixed repertoire of original and traditional songs, Yothu Yindi, became a microcosm of the kind of world its founders wanted to live in. A world where people with different cultural backgrounds, languages and skin colours could exchange ideas and ways of doings things to create something new within a framework of equality, understanding and mutual respect. Along the way, its music introduced audiences all over the world to the unique beauty of Yolngu culture, and challenged Australians to think again about Indigenous rights.</blockquote>
			Yothu Yindi’s use of traditional Yolngu elements, such as the prominence of <em>yidaki</em> (didjeridu) and <em>bilma</em> (paired sticks) mixed with Western rock band instrumentation and song structure has been noted as an example of the Yolngu concept of <em>ganma</em> (Corn 2006; Stubington & Dunbar Hall, 1994; Yunupingu 1994) and as such can be seen as an embodiment of the both ways method. This mixing of cultural elements fits in with Yunupingu’s approach of acceptance and resistance in order to strengthen the Yolngu cultural identity. He writes: ‘We had to take account of Western ideas both positive ones and negative ones and accept the ones that would help us strengthen our culture’ (Yunupingu 1999, p. 2). Yunupingu believed placing Indigenous culture in the spotlight was integral to teaching non-Aboriginal Australian’s of the different knowledge systems of Aboriginal Australia. He believed this lack of understanding was the for the horrific treatment of Indigenous Australians by the hands of European colonisers and successive governments who saw Aboriginal Australians as inferior, ‘like a smudge on paper that could be rubbed out’ (Yunupingu 1994, p. 120). To this end, the popular music format was used as a medium in order for Yolngu culture to be raised to an internationally recognised platform. The single ‘Treaty’ released in 1991 on <em>Tribal Voices</em> became the first charting song anywhere to include an Indigenous Australian language (Corn 2009, p. 163), Yothu Yindi’s film clips capture depictions of traditional <em>Bungul</em> (dance) and rituals as seen in ‘Djapana: Sunset Dreaming’ (1989); ‘Treaty’ (1991); ‘Tribal Voice’ (1991) amongst others. A clear and deliberate move to showcase the beauty and sophistication of Yolngu ways.<br>
			By elevating Yolngu traditions to a mainstream audience, Yothu Yindi worked towards creating a space where Indigenous Australian traditions and voices are accepted not as ‘other’ or ‘world-music’ but instead as standing on equal platform with popular trends in music. This elevating of Indigenous cultural platform to the mainstream is a movement towards de-Othering Indigenous identity and cultural practices thereby creating a space in which Indigenous voices can operate and act towards self determination. The rise in mainstream acceptance of musicians and bands singing in Indigenous languages such as Gurrumul and Electric Fields is indication of a shift in thinking about the position of Indigenous voices within popular spheres.</p>
			<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
			<p>Both ways thinking, at its core, is a methodology that moves towards decolonising modes of knowledge transference. It does not presuppose a Western-centric supremacy but instead places Indigenous thought processes on an equal footing. This creates a fundamental shift in inherent power structures allowing Indigenous cultures to gain control of their cultural identity as well as raising the platform of their voices. Mandawuy Yunupingu championed the both ways method both in the school curriculum at Yirrkala and in the popular rock band Yothu Yindi. As a tactic of resistance to modes of colonised thinking, Yothu Yindi’s repertoire championed Yolngu culture and raised awareness of Indigenous struggles against continued subjugation to dominant structures of power. This raising of platform of Yolngu culture allowed for the preservation of Yolngu cultural identity by increasing the prevalence and practice of traditional modes of thinking and culture which can be, and has been, used by other Indigenous identities. The both ways method of embedding Indigenous culture and practices in Western mediums not only creates a recorded documentation of that cultural practice, it also creates a sense of pride and ownership of one’s cultural identity as it acts to legitimise it within mainstream discourse.</p>
