		<h1>The Limitations of the 10 Agents of Deterioration: The Need for a Community Focused Approach to Conservation</h1>

		<div class="content">

			<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
			<p><em>The 10 agents of deterioration create a framework conservators can use to achieve a good overview of potential causes of material damage to heritage collections but little room for assessment of intangible damage. This paper argues a community-focused, slow-conservation approach is required for comprehensive preventive conservation and risk-assessment approach. It looks at examples of functional heritage objects and conceptually loaded contemporary art to show a need for community involvement in the decision-making process. It shows a purposeful and community integrated approach results in a more sustainable conservation due to the benefits afforded by engagement with local community and people.</em></p>
			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>This paper will show that the 10 agents of deterioration’s systemic approach to quantify causes of deterioration to cultural heritage collections fails to fully encapsulate the intangible heritage significance of cultural collections. Chris Caple (2012, p. 152) defines preventive conservation as ‘all measures taken to preserve an object short of specific interaction with the physical form of the object’. As an object’s significance and meaning is partly determined by its intangible qualities, preventative conservation methods that do not consider the interconnected nature of cultural heritage will be left wanting. Dissociation is the only agent of deterioration that comes close to encapsulating this broader classification of significance for cultural heritage, yet still falls short in this capacity. This will lead us to consider the need for a community focused approach to cultural heritage and see how the inclusion of people and place provides a more holistic and sustainable model for the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>
			<h3><b>The 10 agents of deterioration: a review</b></h3>
			<p>The 10 agents of deterioration are a framework used to systemically identify potential hazards to heritage collections in order to inform future looking, decision-making and risk-assessments. They are: physical forces, fire, pests, light, incorrect relative humidity, incorrect temperature, water, pollutants-contaminants, criminal activity, and dissociation. What becomes plainly clear from a quick observation is the materials focused emphasis the 10 agents have. It becomes evident that dissociation is the sole agent of deterioration that is concerned with the non-material and meta-layers of information. Dissociation ‘results from the natural tendency for ordered systems to fall apart over time’ (CCI 2017). It ‘results in loss of objects, or object-related data, or the ability to retrieve or associate objects and data' (CCI 2017). Being able to physically access individual items within a collection is integral to its significance, therefore dissociation by the loss of cataloging and accession numbers represents a terrible loss of value. This was evidenced by a recent risk analysis of the F.A. Singleton Collection at the University of Melbourne (Morrison et al. 2019) which found, by far, the biggest risk to the collection was dissociation of almost all elements of the collection. Whilst it was recognised loss of cataloguing information was damaging, the quantitive, materials based approach, did not allow much room for data coalition of other intangible sources of value in the collection, such as departmental prestige and idiosyncratic collection to the Earth Science community who previously cared for the collections.</p>
			<h3><b>Towards an emphasis on the intangible in the 10 agents of deterioration</b></h3>
			<p>The 10 agents of deterioration are primarily designed to identify hazards posed to the physical materiality of heritage collections, with dissociation being the only agent of deterioration that directly applies to intangible qualities. Yet, even in this capacity, as noted by Alison Wain (2017, p. 91), dissociation primarily relates to ‘the loss of connection between records (such as labels and database entries) and the objects they document, not the loss of connection between people and those objects’. This leaves a large portion of significance not covered by the 10 agents of deterioration. The conservation profession has shown an increased awareness of the need for the identification and preservation of intangible heritage (ICOMOS 1994; UNESCO 2003). As Miriam Clavir (2002, p. xvii) notes, for First Nations Peoples 'preservation of the cultural significance of heritage objects as inseparable from the preservation of traditions, oral history, community and identity as First Nations; preservation is about people’. What Clavir identifies is the need for a shift of focus from cultural objects as static, unchanging, and fixed towards an interconnected ontology that views cultural objects as in flux. For any cultural material there are a number of differing, yet equally valid, interpretations of authenticity (Scott, 2015), which necessarily problematises the notion of the ideal, point-zero, against which cultural material is preserved and valued against. Thus, for preventive conservation measures to fully preserve the significances of cultural material it must consider aspects beyond the primacy of physical materiality presupposed by the 10 agents of deterioration.<br><br>Two examples of this need to broaden understanding of a cultural object’s significance are moving cultural objects, such as industrial machines or kinetic artworks, and contemporary conceptually loaded artworks. Wain (2017, p. 9) notes the importance functionality plays in industrial heritage objects’ significance: ‘regularity of movement is important for effective preservation of both tangible and intangible heritage aspects’, or, as Thurrowgood and Hallam (2004 p. 2) state: ‘the fact that machines are designed to work is pivotal to their significance’. Whilst movement and functionality pose risks to heritage objects most notably from physical forces such as vibration and abrasion, a conservation approach that denies the cultural significance of a machine’s operation due to a risk-averse approach fails to preserve integral aspects of the object. This focus on the fabric of the cultural object fails to equally value the connection to ‘people, place and time’ that form integral aspects of a collection’s significance (Tse et al. 2018, p. S280). It has been suggested that video footage of a kinetic object functioning, at the very least, should be taken to safeguard possible restoration efforts (Ketnath 2005, p. 375), but even this, Wain argues (2017 p. 91), fails to preserve fully ‘the skills and knowledge required to understand and operate it, the culture of communities who work with machinery, and the experience of seeing, hearing, smelling, and feeling it work’. There is something essential to the intangible meaning in the function of objects. Conservators and curators must weigh up the significance of their collections and ask what is more important: the original materials or the connection to culture and community? Is the potential for damage to occur by running this machine less than the intangible aspects of its correct operation, tacit knowledge and all? If the functionality of a heritage objects is lost, a major source of value and significance is lost with it. There is no necessary black or white, right or wrong, answer to the question. It is, however, something that should be considered with consultation with community experts and non-experts alike, weighed up with an evaluation of risks involved, both from action and inaction. What the question does pose is, an increased importance and emphasis on the non-material, intangible, aspects of collections.<br><br>We have seen the importance intangible elements have on collections and the communities they belong to; we will now consider a somewhat extreme example of the tensions that may arise from a purely material based assessment of cultural material when presented with a heavily conceptually loaded artwork. Catalonian artist Antoni Miralda (1942-) often uses food and other biodegradable materials in his work to comment on issues surrounding national- identity, globalisation and consumer-culture (Borja-Villel 2010). The piece <em>Food Situation for a Patriotic Banquet</em> (1972/2010, and recreated for the 2016/2017 exhibition MIRALDA MADEINUSA at Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA)) consists of, amongst other ephemera, eight trays of food-dyed rice to represent the national flags of world-powers. During the course of the work’s display the flags grow mould and slowly deteriorate to a homogenous mass of unrecognisable plates that ‘poetically [emphasise] the project’s post-nationalist politics’ (Rosenblum & Roma 2010, p. 120). Thus, the meaning of the work itself is derived from microbial deterioration which could fall under the pollutant-contamination agent of deterioration. Like with the machinery example above, a risk-assessment of such a work requires one to move beyond the material condition of the work and consider a broader range of significance in need of preservation. Gilman, Jacxens and Demeulanaer (2016, pp. 11) in a paper on food-based perishable art call for a pragmatic conservation approach that ‘[retraces] the meaning of the artwork as a whole and how the food materials contribute to its meaning’. It should, therefore, be clear that the physical integrity of the object may not necessarily encapsulate the meaning of works, and that a broader understanding may be required to accurately preserve an object.<br><br>Miralda’s work, of course, sits on an extreme end of the material-meaning spectrum, most artworks are not designed to deteriorate so rapidly. However, we can take from this example the value placed in meaning. For <em>Food Situation for a Patriotic Banquet</em> artistic intent determines the meaning, but for many cultural objects meaning is derived from connection to community and people. Any preventive conservation must take into account community interests and be inclusive of the people who are the custodians of the collection. With the increasing diversity of contemporary art, as well as an ever growing awareness of the needs to meet differing cultural values, the net thrown by the 10 agents can miss important elements of a people-focused cultural collection. The loss of meaning to a work, or the loss of integral experiences to objects represents a dissociation that is often overlooked by the physical materiality focused 10 agents of deterioration. This is not to say the preventive steps to limit the effects of the 10 agents should be abandoned completely, but instead when assessing collections conservators and curators may be tasked with broadening their conceptual framework of what constitutes significance. We will now turn our attention towards strategies of creating this people-focused conservation in line with our new understanding of the importance of preserving intangible significance in cultural collections.</p>
			<h3><b>Absolute limits limit absolutely: A community focused approach to conservation</b></h3>
			<p>As we have demonstrated above, there are a number of thresholds that have been created in order to create the ‘ideal’ environment to prevent degradation of collections most notably, 20°C ± and 50% RH ± (IIC 2010). Recently, however, new approaches to preventive conservation are calling for a more localised and pragmatic approach to environmental thresholds. Consideration of local conditions that respond to the local environment instead of rigid standards offer a more sustainable approach to conservation. Many issues can be mitigated by considering the heritage collection as part of an interconnected system that is linked to community and place. An open- ended approach like this requires a shift in risk-assessment that considers the entire collection holistically. It also requires a shift away from a risk-averse approach and encourages a more active involvement in the decision-making process (Henderson & Waller 2016).<br><br>Sarah Staniforth (2010) argues for a preventative conservation that looks at a collection as a whole and strives to produce a stable collection environment in the most efficient and sustainable way possible - slow conservation. The slow conservation model calls for a more
			community minded practice that incorporates local participation as an integral step in the preservation of cultural material. ICCROM (Court & Wijesuriya 2015, p. 3) write, on a people- centred approach to cultural heritage, that: ‘at heritage places that are considered to be a “living” part of their community [...], the community’s engagement often brings advantages to both heritage and community alike.’ Incorporating communities into policies governing cultural heritage allows for a greater connection between society and heritage, and therefore fosters an environment that encourages more active community input.<br><br>To this end, culture, as the fourth pillar of sustainability, along with ecological, social and economic (Yencken & Wilkinson 2000, p. 9), represents a major governance framework to create a more inclusive and open ended heritage strategy that is less impactful on resources and the environment. It has been argued that cultural action is the necessary initial step for sustainable models of public planning, that ‘active community participation in arts practice is an essential component of a healthy and sustainable society’ (Hawkes 2001, p. 38) and that ‘communities have a right, as well as a responsibility, to engage with the values that determine the nature of the society of which they are a part’ (Hawkes 2001, p. 16). The slow conservation approach creates this more connected system that responds to local needs and relaxes rigid standards, allowing cultural collections to operate in more sustainable conditions closer to their natural environment. A sustainable, local community approach to cultural heritage planning has led to a number of innovations in the application of local knowledge and materials into creating preventive conservation solutions for cultural collections such as buildings insulated using traditional methods and local materials (Staniforth 2010). All of these approaches touch on policy buzzwords, but ultimately benefit their community by encouraging increased participation of local people and use of local resources.</p>
			<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
			<p>We have looked at the 10 agents of deterioration and seen that they place too much of an emphasis on an object’s physical materiality whilst neglecting the intangible connection to meaning created through community and place. Preventive conservation, if it is to achieve its goal of preserving cultural heritage, must consider cultural material as a component in an interconnected system that is placed within, and responds to, community and culture. To achieve this, a slow-conservation approach can be utilised that places the community and people as playing an essential role in the decision making process. This allows for intangible significance to play a key role in collection care that is embodied in a cultural context. Being community minded, likewise, sees heritage collections as components in a complex system that can reduce the use of resources by reacting with the environment it is located in.</p>
