		The thesis looked at two case studies of internet-based artworks:
			<br><br>
		<a href="http://marclee.io/tvbot/?q1=Coronavirus&q2=COVID-19&d1=fa-umbrella.42c0ff.b&d2=fa-ambulance.17df00.b" target="_blank"> Marc Lee’s TV-Bot (V.1.0 2004, V.2.0 2010, V.3.0 2016) (which unfortunately has ceased to function properly on my computer. So instead, here is Covid Bot 2020 which uses the same script but with a resulting 'newsfeed' that is specific to Covid-19)</a> 
		<br><br>and 
		<br><br>
		<a href="http://brandon.guggenheim.org/" target="_blank"> Shu Lea Cheang’s Brandon (1998-1999). An interactive narrative website based off of the life and death of Trans man Brandon Teena</a>
		<br><br>
		With the three-part conceptual framework in mind, I looked at published documentation reports on the artworks to identify what work defining properties were needed to be documented and how they can be utilised for future preservation.
		<br><br>
		Of note was the distinct differences in documentation requirements for both artworks. TV-Bot was found to be much more about the conceptual idea of providing ‘liveness’ of the news feed the TV-Bot program produced (Gassert 2013). This position is supported by the artist’s willingness to create updated versions of the work containing visual and functional upgrades to better align with current news consumption trends (Gassert 2013; Himmelsbach 2019; Lee qtd in Blanc 2013).

		This required a greater documentary emphasis on the intentionality sphere of the documentation triad. 
		<br><br>
		Whereas, Brandon’s treatment saw a much greater emphasis on retaining the original style and ‘feel’ of the source code. This was evidenced by the care taken to retain outdated coding choices within the source code (Engel et al. 2018), aligning the produced documentary emphasis with the materiality sphere of the documentation triad. </p></div>

	<div class="content_next">
		<p>	Both artworks have produced video documentation of the functioning artwork, partially fulfilling the functionality/user experience sphere. <a href="https://marclee.io/en/tv-bot-world-news-as-soon-as-it-happens/" target="_blank">TV-Bot’s accompanying video documentation is designed to be played on period appropriate hardware when the work is installed in an institutional setting, providing both an easily accessible record of intended functionality and also historicity of behaviours of previous iterations of the work.</a>
		<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq2_t3U_f9U" target="_blank">The Guggenheim has produced a screen capture video of Brandon with accompanying voice over. This document provides users with a guide on how to navigate the work, and how the pop up elements are intended to display on a computer screen.</a> 
		<br><br>
		Obviously, these video recordings flatten the dynamic and interactive dimension of online content. But utilised in conjunction with the other documentation nodes, they create a strong basis for future preservation efforts.
		<br><br>
		Missing from both artwork’s documentation is the broader user experience of each work. To this end, the third aspect of the documentation triad appears to have been somewhat overlooked within current documentation initiatives, despite it potentially providing invaluable information about the broader societal impact of the artwork and its easily accessible visual representation work behaviour (Spreeuwenberg 2011). An increased utilisation of documenting the user experience can round out current institutional documentation approaches and provide a fuller picture of these types of artworks and how they sit within their socio-cultural frameworks.</p></div>

	<div class='content_next' style="margin-bottom:80%">
		<p>	No single form of documentation will be perfect for time-based media art. The format is too variable and too complex to be reduced down to a standard set of instructions or standardised workflow. By providing a higher level conceptual documentation approach to internet-based art, it is hoped that a greater understanding of the required components of a flexible and adaptable documentation method is achieved. Laying the framework for the production of quality documentation that takes into account the material, intentional and broader socio-cultural dimension of internet-based art, the outlined conceptual approach hopefully addresses the deeper importance of applying documentation to internet-based art. Through documentation of internet-based art, adequate measures have been taken to allow for their preservation into the future. Internet-based art poses an interesting problem to conservators as its medium is inherently unstable and constantly changing, both in its soft/hardware dependencies and in terms of user engagement. It is hoped that by setting up documentation approaches that are flexible enough to adapt to changes in such a risk-heavy format they can be extrapolated outwards to work with time-based media art in the broader sense.</p></div>
