			This increased institutional focus on internet-based artworks offers an excellent opportunity for a better understanding of documentation approaches for internet-based art preservation practices.

			<p>The reality of twenty-first century technological advancements is the near complete ubiquity and access to online digital media (in the developed world). This is not to say internet-based art is a new phenomenon - artist’s have been using proto-internet networks in their practice since at least the 1970s (Bosma 2019) - the medium, as art form in its own right, began gaining broader institutional recognition in the 1990s - (in)famously with a dedicated internet-art section at 1997’s Documenta X in Kassel, Germany, that failed to appreciate the inherent nature of online art. Over time, internet-based art has become more accepted by major institutions and is being added to their collections:</p></div>

			<p>	Artworks that incorporate internet connectivity as a defining aspect of their identity are especially vulnerable to all the risks associated with time-based media art. Internet-based art draws its meaning from the 'in-between' space of the network, creating situations of variability and change outside of conservator, curator and even artist control. As visualised by the MTAA's simple netart diagram (ca. 1997):<br>

			Internet-based artworks are at risk of ceasing to function through the constant cycles of updates and depreciation of software standards such as browser compatibility and plugin support (or lack thereof). Once dominant forms of online content can lose support and disappear from online environments completely, as most notably, has occur with the decline, and eventual (at the end of this year) death, of Adobe Flash support with online browsers:</p></div>

			<p>	Internet art is interactive and variable. It is open-ended and designed to change. Such artworks question the fundamental principles of traditional modes of conservation. Whereas conservation has historically had an object-centric focus - restoring the material integrity of cultural objects (Applebaum 2010) - time-based media artworks have no overarching point-zero to which they can be returned (Hölling 2017).
			<br><br>
			This results in the necessary increase of emphasis on documentation as a method for conservation. 
			<br><br>
			Despite this, professional conservation bodies are yet to update their codes of ethics and practice to accomodate the primary importance documentation can play as an act of conservation. Instead, documentation is treated as a secondary byproduct of the conservation act (American Institute of Conservation 1994; Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Materials 2002; Institute of Conservation 2014).
			<br><br>
			I argue that moving beyond this understanding of documentation will open avenues for an expanded conservation approach that utilises documentation itself as an act of conservation. Internet-based art presents an extreme example of the issues for the preservation of time-based media art. Its interactivity and frequent cycles of obsolescence make a solely material object-centric conservation approach impossible, the question is not <br><br>
