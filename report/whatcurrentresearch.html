			where does the research fit within the current conservation field
		</b></h3>

		<p>	Documentation initiatives provide guidance and standards for institutions to follow which assist with long-term care for their collections. These initiatives produce large quantities of paperwork providing varied levels of usefulness. The thesis looked at defining properties of documentation initiatives and places their emphasis within a three-conceptual framework structure consisting of: materiality, intentionality and functionality/user experience. This is done in order to create a streamlined approach to documentation that avoids an over reliance on rigid templates and the production of unnecessary paperwork. Instead, a more flexible and adaptable approach can be utilised in order to meet the needs of individual artworks within the institutional setting.</p>

		<h3> Variable Media Network </h3>
		<p>The Variable Media Network was foundational in reframing preservation workflows towards intentionality and away from materiality as primary focus. TThe VMN asks artists to consider their artwork ‘independently from medium’ (‘Variable Media Network’, n.d.) to allow for managed, acceptable change through inevitable cycles of equipment obsolescence.</p></div>

	<div class="content_next">
		<h3> Matters in Media Art </h3>
		<p>Standing in contrast to the Variable Media Network is the primarily materials focused Matters in Media Art (MMA) initiative. The MMA has produced a number of templates and workflows to follow for pre-, during-, and post- acquisition of media art. The MMA is designed to create workflows that allow institutions to properly understand the requirements of maintaining the media art they acquire and to understand what exactly it is they are acquiring. The heavy focus on recording material component details positions the MMA as a primarily materiality focused initiative.</p></div>

		<h3> Conserving Computer Based Art Initiative </h3>
		<p>	The more software-art specific Conserving Computer Based Art (CCBA) initiative, broadly, lies further towards the materiality side of the spectrum with a focus on identifying and recording at-risk hardware and software components of software-based artworks. Unlike the MMA and VMN, the CCBA has a heavy focus on the preservation potential of software-based art’s source code. The usefulness of source code for conservation has been questioned as possibly providing ‘a false sense of security’ (Dekker & Falcão 2016, p. 6) but it is argued (Engel et al. 2018; Engel & Phillips 2018; 2019; Engel & Wharton 2014; 2015) that through source code analysis defining characteristics of an artwork can be identified. The utilisation of a software engineering approach, as argued by the CCBA (Engel & Wharton 2014), can create documentation that allows future conservators to read the artwork and discern its behaviour, the artist’s methods/style and other work defining properties for preservation purposes.</p></div>

	<div class='content_next'>
		<p> Although these initiatives touch on documenting functionality and user experience - for example: the CCBA briefly mentions documenting the installed artwork (‘The Conserving Computer-Based Art Initiative’ n.d.) and the MMA calls for ‘[videotaping] the initial installation’ (‘Documenting Media Art’ 2015) - there is no direct addressing the interactivity and experience of users. This potentially omits entire aspects of artworks from receiving adequate documentation - the socio-cultural and community behavioural aspect of online environments</p></div>

	<div class='content_next' style="margin-bottom:80%">
		<p>To this end, the Dullaart-Sakrawski Method is a documentation method that aims to record the user experience and surrounding contextual information of internet-based artworks as executed in their intended environments - a personal computer. Documentation of the functioning work and how it is experienced by users can provide a means of understanding a work long after its original components and software become obsolete (Marchese 2011). Documenting user exeperience allows for capturing the culturally embedded aspects of the online culture that defines much of the core identity of online art</p></div>
