			<p>This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in <em>The AICCM Bulletin</em> on 31 December 2021, available online: <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/10344233.2021.2000177" target=blank>http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/10344233.2021.2000177</a>.</p>
			<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
			<p><em>Internet-based art is deeply embedded in the online behaviours, customs and traditions that are constantly emerging through user interaction and engagement. As such, user experience should be considered a fundamental aspect of the artwork in need of considered documentation. This paper provides a historical overview of Internet-based art, that presents the broader socio-cultural aspects of Internet-based art, as experienced by the user. This paper argues that Internet-based art requires the same conservation considerations as more accepted aspects of time-based media art documentation: source-code analysis, materials and equipment lists, variability and artists’ intent. By documenting user experience, it enables opportunities to navigate the culturally-embedded principles of Internet culture and contemporary technological standards that may be lost if preservation strategies utilise a more material/code specific preservation strategy. Highlighting experience as a necessary pillar of the identity of Internet-based art, in conjunction with other widely accepted aspects of time-based media art documentation approaches, it allows for a richer picture and understanding of defining qualities of works, whilst providing further evidentiary activation into preservation approaches. </em></p>
			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>The Internet is built around an online culture that is constantly evolving.</p>
			<p>In the early 2000s, users were reassured in the permanence of online content, that it could exist on the Internet ‘forever’. However, this sentiment, along with digital heritage more broadly, is increasingly being called into question (UNESCO 2009). From the mass loss of Myspace profiles in 2019 (Hern 2019) to the phase out of the once ubiquitous Adobe Flash at the end of 2020 (LaForge 2017), the stability of online content is far from assured. As online protocols and standards are updated to meet rapid technological advancement, the cultural impact of online browsing changes; older user habits are forgotten and new norms emerge.  Due to the interactive and socially laden nature of the online environment, user access and ongoing preservation of online content needs be adapted or else cease functioning.</p>
			<p>This paper explores the challenges surrounding access, documentation and preservation of Internet-based artworks. By their nature, these are designed to be executed by users and are loaded with interconnections to the broader socio-cultural environment that makes up the Internet. Contemporary art conservation documentation methodologies found within the time-based media discipline seek to capture both the material aspects and artistic intent of an artwork (Laurenson 2006; Phillips 2015; Hölling 2017; Sherring, Murphy & Catt 2018; Kramer et al. 2021). This broad approach to preservation has the potential to be a valuable method for some aspects of Internet-based art. However, it still falls short of capturing the full extent of the essential qualities of the medium of Internet-based art, namely the user experience. As such, a rigorous documentation strategy for preserving Internet-based artworks requires new methods to document user experience that focus on how audiences interact with works, human idiosyncratic response to elements, as well as the software and hardware elements used to engage with the artwork.</p>
			<p>Art that incorporates or relies on networked connections is a contested term with differing names and definitions (Greene 2004; Bosma 2011; Dekker 2018). For the purpose of this paper, the term Internet-based art refers to artworks that incorporate or rely on a connection to a networked connection. Additionally, the author has made a distinction between Internet-based art, either it is – a) accessed virtually from a personal device outside of a gallery setting; or b) experienced in a physically-determined location, such as an art gallery. This paper provides historical context by discussing early works that predate the widespread popularity of Internet accessible devices, however, the primary focus is on virtually accessible Internet-based art.</p>
			<h3><b>What is Internet-based art?</b></h3>
			<p>Internet-based art poses a multitude of preservation issues for the conservator. As an artform, it questions the ‘traditional categories of art and the myriad institutions that support them’ (Respini 2018, p. 16). As with many digital media artworks, hardware obsolescence and discontinued software support pose risks to long term preservation of Internet-based art. However, one of the most pressing conservation issues is inherent to the medium; the uncontrollable variability of networked connections. As the artist duo, MTAA demonstrates through the <a href='vhttp://www.mtaa.net/mtaaRR/off-line_art/snad.html' target=blank><em>Simple Net Art Diagram</em> (ca. 1997)</a>, Internet-based art is something that happens and that it is defined by ‘in-betweenness’. As Connor, Dean & Espenschied (2019) describe:</p> 
			<p><em>the “here” in [<em>Simple Net Art Diagram</em>] is the space between machines — a network context from which a work cannot be extracted without altering it fundamentally (p. 81).</em></p>

			<p>This results in entire aspects and components of Internet-based art falling outside of the direct control of conservators, curators and often even the artists themselves. More than just simply content that is online, Internet-based art is ‘profoundly implicated in both the conceptual space of the network and its expanded materiality, which includes social and economic aspects as well as myriad technological possibilities’ (Bosma 2019, p. 389). Internet-based art exists in the space between source code and social context. It is ‘art that acts on the network, or is acted on by it’ (Rhizome 2016). As such, it derives its meaning not only from the work itself, but also from users interacting with the network environment and their peers on it. As Internet-based artworks are embedded within the Internet itself, it is tied to a virtual culture that is in constant flux (Bosma 2011, p. 24). Consequently, this medium is not a ‘fixed entity, but a place, a set of relationships, and a socioeconomic framework’ (Jones 2018, p. 84). Internet-based art, therefore, requires new kinds of preservation efforts to maintain this dynamic relationship between components and users. </p>
			<h3><b>Internet-based art: A brief history</b></h3>
			<p>Internet-based art rose to prominence in the early 1990s (Greene 2004; Bosma 2011; Moss 2019). It’s rise mostly attributed to a small collection of artists who worked outside of institutional systems ‘exploring the possibilities of the Internet and the World Wide Web’ (Bosma 2011, p. 126). Although largely linked to the rise of personal computers and the intrusion of the Internet into everyday lives, Internet-based art has its origins in proto-internet networks as early as the 1970s (Bosma 2019), and art-historical precedents in the Fluxus movement, Happenings and Experiments in Art and Technology (Greene 2004). Overtime, the Internet has penetrated almost every aspect of our daily lives and has grown and proliferated alongside the contemporary art world. Despite an increase in the acquisition of Internet-based works, questions around appropriate methods of preservation remain open (Bomsa 2007; Dekker 2018).</p>
			<h3><b><em>Early Internet-based artwork: net.art movement </em></b></h3>
			<p>With the rising popularity of the World Wide Web and personal computers in the nineties, early Internet-based artists and artist collectives such as the net.art movement set the foundations for the Internet as a medium for art production (Greene 2004; Bosma 2011). Though short lived, this period of Internet-based art resulted in the ‘misinterpretation of the Internet as one medium with one specific aesthetic in which net.art was wrongly perceived as Web- or even screen-based’ (Bosma 2011, p. 129).</p>
			<p>This misinterpretation often neglected the networked connection inherent to Internet-based art, and instead, reduced the interconnective potential of the Internet to a singular and fixed entity. This goes against what the artists of the time were trying to achieve, which was a radical rethinking of the structures of artistic expression and engagement by creating ‘new independent art organizations and approaches to evade traditional structures’ (Bosma 2011, p. 129) and ‘whose flexibility, dislocation, and interactivity relate a new means of socially impactful communication and connection’ (Moss 2019, p. 13).</p>
			<h3><b><em>Early Internet-based artwork: documenta X exhibition</em></b></h3>
			<p>The 1997 documenta X exhibition in Kassel, Germany, marked one of the first serious attempts at including Internet-based art as a legitimate form of internationally-recognised contemporary art practice. Its inclusion in the influential exhibition was an attempt of ‘broadening the theoretical and participatory scope of documenta’ (Jones 2017, p. 82), creating a ‘framework both intimate and global, in one’s own living room and in the most varied corners of our world’ (David 1997).  Its presence at documenta X can be seen as a major indication of mainstream legitimation of Internet-based art as a serious art form.</p>
			<p>While this exhibition marks a significant moment in the global recognition of the artistic merits of Internet-based art, it also highlighted an institutional failure to fully understand the inherent characteristics of the medium (Jones 2017). The first failure on the part of documenta X was the decision to physically disconnect the Internet-based art section from the rest of the exhibition. As Josephine Bosma (2011) describes, this immediately highlighted the ‘discrepancy between the traditional art world and online art practices’ (p. 151) by distinguishing the works as fundamentally different. </p>

			<p>Additionally, the artworks were presented as ‘standalone objects’ (Bosma 2011, p. 152) disconnected from their place within the network for which they were intended. Instead, they were hosted on a local area network unconnected to the open web (Jones 2018, p. 82). The decision to display these artworks via an internal network within the gallery subsequently locked the artworks to the display environment, rather than functioning in the open networks of the world wide web, as the artists intended. As Caitlin Jones (2018) explains:</p>

			<p><em>while the exhibition certainly advanced discussions about the internet’s potential to challenge the primacy of the art object and to reach broader audiences online, it fails miserably at capturing the ways in which artists were actually using their networks and the Web to critique traditional art world structures, intellectual property, and the changing nature of public space (Jones 2018, p.83).</em></p>

			<h3><b><em>Internet-based art in the age of social media</em></b></h3>

			<p>As the Internet became more pervasive in everyday life, the means of distributing Internet-based art also changed. Early Internet-based artworks were often built by artists using bespoke software on privately operated servers. Whereas today, Internet-based art is often built inside of, and as critique of, established-third party (social) media platforms. This poses the complex problem of how to preserve the aesthetic and user interactivity of works that rely on closed-source commercial properties and the dense online cultures built around them. </p>
			<h3><em>Artwork utilising the social media platform Youtube:</em> VVebcam</h3>
			

			<p>Petra Cortright’s <a href='http://archive.rhizome.org/anthology/vvebcam/' target=blank><em>VVebcam</em></a> (2007) is a YouTube hosted video performance art piece. The work incorporated the then design of YouTube’s platform, such as visible metadata tags and the comments section as part of the work. The work featured ‘a string of terms often used by spam accounts on the platform […] designed to draw in viewers who were trawling for titillating or offensive material’ (Connor, Dean & Espenschied (eds) 2019, p. 242). Occasionally, Cortright (2007) engaged with users who posted in the comments section, which further contributed to the interactive and variable nature of the work. The overall result was a performance that drew attention to, and offered commentary on, the nature of the online platform and the behaviours of users on it. </p>

			<p><em>VVebcam</em> (2007) was included in the 2010 exhibition <em>Surfing Club</em> at plug.in Basel, Switzerland. While the work was on display for the exhibition YouTube updated the design of their platform, altering the appearance of some elements of the work. Despite this, the exhibition curator Raffael Dörig (2013) notes that, ‘the exhibition did not have to be cancelled. A somewhat different aspect of the work was emphasized […which, maintained the…] line between video art [and] internet art’ (p. 213) that Cortright envisioned of the work. After the conclusion of <em>Surfing Club</em>, another YouTube update removed essential elements, such as changing the ‘related videos’ field – based off of the metadata hashtags – to primarily videos from the uploader (Dörig 2013, pp. 213-214). Ultimately <em>VVebcam</em> (2007), along with many of Cortright’s other videos, were removed from YouTube all together having been labelled as spam due to the inflammatory metadata hashtags utilised as part of the work. An archival reconstruction of the work has since been produced for Rhizome’s <em>Net Art Anthology</em> restoring its original design, albeit without the ability for user interaction.</p>

			<h3><b><em>Artwork utilizing the social media platform Instagram:</em> Excellence & Perfections</b></h3>
			

			<p>Similarly, Amalia Ulman’s <a href="https://webenact.rhizome.org/excellences-and-perfections/20141014162333/http://instagram.com/amaliaulman" target=blank><em>Excellence & Perfections</em></a> (2014) is a four-month performance piece utilising the social media platform Instagram. The work consists of ‘photos, captions, user interactions, and the exact presentation of these materials’ (Google arts and Culture n.d.).  Described as Instagram’s ‘first masterpiece’, the work posed a challenge around how to preserve the presentation of an artwork held on a commercial platform (Sooke 2016). The work was archived using Rhizome’s web archiving tool conifer (formerly webrecorder), which creates a snapshot of how the work looked at the time of its completion, albeit with reduced user interactivity. Since the creation of <em>Excellence and Perfections </em>(2014), Instagram has implemented several design and user experience changes. Two fundamental changes are the introduction of ‘Stories’ in 2016, which encourages the publishing of short-lived content that is removed after 24 hours (Instagram 2016), and an algorithmically generated user feed. These changes have impacted the behavioural interaction with social media platforms, making Rhizome’s archiving even more important for preserving the artwork as it was intended.</p>

			<p>These works demonstrate that preservation methods require flexibility and fluidity to meet the requirements of documenting the diverse spectrum of Internet-based art. Balancing artistic intent and the connection to the network through to the risks of commercial platform redesigns changing the nature of performance-based artworks, preservation strategies for Internet-based art must provide a means of maintaining the variable, interactive user-experience of the medium.</p>

			<h3><b>The materiality of Internet-based art: More than HTML and CSS</b></h3>

			<p>The front-end infrastructure of the Internet is built by Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for design elements, and Javascript for some aspects of user interactivity. These protocols and standards are interpreted by web browsers to deliver the web experience to the end user. However, there is much more to the construction and end user experience than what is contained within these protocols and programming language. Early computing saw the emergence of ‘customs, traditions and elements of visual, textual and audio culture […] from user’s engagement with personal computer applications’ (Lialina & Espenschied 2009, pp. 9-10) that made their way into the emerging Internet. The Internet is its own microcosm of conventions, norms and behaviours: in short, its own culture. Internet-based art feeds into this socio-cultural framework and exists, not as a singular instance on the network, but as a node within an inter-connected and inter-dependent system. As Mark Leckey (in Moss 2019) describes it has, ‘no centre’. It is ‘responsive to the decentered [sic] quality [of contemporary art practice]’ (2019, p. 1). It exists as an ‘expanded’ field ‘as a continuously multiple element that exists within a distributed system’ (Moss 2019, pp. 9-10).</p>

			<p>By their nature, works on the Internet rely on interactive engagement from an end user in order to be executed and experienced. Often this plays out in the form of a personal computer in the privacy of one’s own home (though not necessarily). Integral to the development of the early Internet was the impact of the ‘users’ who ‘were literally building the Internet’ (Lialina & Espenschied 2009, p. 11). The Internet, as described by Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied (2009), was built by the users who created webpages and cultural behaviours on it: the space that gave birth to personalised GeoCities webpages, webrings, LOLCATS, and through to current political meme pages on Instagram and Facebook. In 2009, Sir Tim Bernes-Lee (2009) stated in a TED talk that he invented the World Wide Web 20 years ago. Lialina and Espenschied (2009) contend, ‘though officially he has the right to claim this, the web is in fact 16 years old, <em>because that is when people started to use it </em>(p. 12 – emphasis added). </p>

			<p>User interaction on the web <em>is</em> what defines it. With Internet-based art so heavily built around the online cultures that support the artform, preservation strategies should place considerable value on documenting the user experience in order to ensure this cultural element is not omitted from the documentation.</p>

			<h3><b>The current limitations of practical conservation treatments for Internet-based art </b></h3>

			<p>There is limited information available on the practical conservation treatments as applied to Internet-based artworks. In recent years, there has been international effort to develop preservation methods that can aid institutions and conservation bodies to better preserve Internet-based art. Of particular note is the not-for-profit art organisation Rhizome, who focus on large scale online Internet-based art archiving (Fino-Radin 2011); published research on the topic, including Annet Dekker’s <em>Collecting and Conserving Net Art: Moving Beyond Conventional Methods</em> and recent case studies by The Solomon R. Guggenheim museum (Solomon R. Guggenheim 2017) and HeK (Himmelsbach 2019); and the publishing  of time-based media conservation departments’ work by collecting institutions such as The Guggenheim (Solomon R. Guggenheim n.d. a), The Museum of Modern Art (Museum of Modern Art n.d.) and The Tate (Tate n.d.) about born-digital art more generally (Rosa 2015). </p>

			<p>In the field of time-based media, the practical application of born-digital preservation techniques such as emulation and migration are utilised by collecting institutions to manage change and variability over time (Depocas, Ippolito & Jones (eds) 2003; Sherring, Murphy & Catt 2018). For the majority of Internet-based artworks, there are no physical materials to acquire, just digital materials such as source and object code, audio, video and image files. Acquisition of these materials can provide a good basis for Internet-based art preservation; however, it must be acknowledged that the supporting infrastructure of the Internet will eventually render the artwork’s code obsolete. </p>

			<p>This has been the case for artworks utilising no longer supported HTML tags, such as JODI’s <a href='http://wwww.jodi.org/betalab/rain/auto.html' target=blank><em>Automatic Rain</em></a> (1995) and, before extensive conservation treatment, Shu Lea Cheang’s <a href="http://brandon.guggenheim.org/" target=blank><em>Brandon</em></a> (1998–1999) (Phillips et al. 2017). Originally, both of these works used the no longer supported &ltblink&gt tag, which enabled text to blink on and off. There are also works that utilised the now defunct Adobe Flash, such as the work by artists, Skawennati Tricia Fragnito & Jason E. Lewis’ <a href='https://www.obxlabs.net/shows/thanksgivingaddress/' target=blank><em>Thanksgiving Address</em></a> (2002) and Young-Has Chang Heavy Industries’ <a href='https://www.tate.org.uk/intermediaart/the_art_of_sleep.shtm' target=blank><em>The Art of Sleep</em></a> (2006). Additionally, there is the possibility that code has utilised any number of libraries, snippets of code not written by the programmer, but instead taken off a publicly accessible source. The use of code libraries potentially creates the risk of built-up code dependencies that may be overlooked during archiving or back up procedures. This creates the potential for code to disappear resulting in the work no longer functioning. As such, these digital archiving techniques can fail to address issues unique to Internet-based art - that which is participatory and a ‘social process’ (Connor 2019, p. 9). This means it is reliant on outside and uncontrollable resources that emulation or migration may fail to adequately capture. </p>

			<p>With the Internet reliant on technology subject to frequent cycles of obsolesce, coupled with the interactive and variable nature of Internet-based art, the ability to produce quality documentation is essential for its preservation into the future. Far from a static, fixed entity, an artwork that is inherently variable like Internet-based art cannot be thought of as closed or complete. It is an open-ended artform where its final state is not a predetermined condition of its identity. Instead, its continued existence lies primarily with the activation of the artwork and user experience, not the functional playback equipment required to support its existence (Sherring, Murphy & Catt 2018). </p>

			<p>Readily available resources and procedures allow for archiving many aspects of online materials. Popular web-based archiving platforms such as Conifer and the Wayback Machine provide some means of recording online websites, and established procedures for digital media preservation provide guidelines around requirements for media backups and workflow migration. However, the broader user engagement of Internet cultures can be lost in the process. Lialina (2009a) notes that ‘creating collections and archives of all the midi files and animated gifs will preserve them for the future but we need to ask more questions. What did these visual, acoustic and navigation elements stand for?’ (p. 20). To put it in more immediate terms: ‘We have studied the history of hypertext, but not the history of Metallica fan web rings or web rings in general’ (Lialina & Espenshied 2009, p. 12). This is the heart of the Internet-based art preservation problem and highlights the need for a deeper documentation approach that can move towards recording and archiving <em>how</em> the Internet-based artwork fits within the broader socio-cultural context of the network. </p>

			<h3><b>Why documentation for Internet-based artworks?</b></h3>

			<p>To meet the challenges of preserving time-based media artworks, several institutional documentation strategies have been developed that allow for the preservation of both the material and ephemeral elements of an artwork. As Annet Dekker states ‘in the case of artworks that contain or consist of components prone to obsolescence, documentation, for better or worse, often becomes a substitute for the project’ (Dekker 2018, p. 3). </p>

			<p>Time-based media documentation initiatives provide guidance and procedures for long term preservation of artworks. However, their documentary emphasis often falls into two broad categories: behavioural and components/materials, as will be shown below. This leaves user experience receiving comparatively less documentary attention. For Internet-based artworks with their heavy emphasis on user interactivity, this creates the potential for this important aspect of the work being overlooked in the documentation process creating the risk of a loss of integral elements in the execution of the work.</p>

			<h3><b><em>Variable Media Network</em></b></h3>

			<p>The Variable Media Network (VMN), launched in 1998, was one of the first initiatives designed specifically to adapt to the variable nature of time-based media. At the time of its initiation, its pragmatic approach towards variable artworks was described as ‘ground-breaking’ (Serexhe 2013, p. 27). The VMN produced a questionnaire with wide parameters to determine, in their own words, an artist’s intent for their work (Rosa 2015, p. 184). This was achieved by focusing on the behavioural characteristics of artworks. The VMN recognises the long-term conservation problems associated with defining artworks based on outdated modes of technological mediums. It cites rapid cycles of innovation and obsolescence, as well as the increasing prevalence of ‘hybrid medium works’ as causes for concern within traditional museological cataloguing practices (Ippolito 2003, p. 47). To mitigate these concerns, the VMN asks artists to describe their work ‘independently from medium’ (Variable Media Network n.d.). This behavioural approach allows the artwork to be ‘translated after its current medium becomes obsolete’ (Dekker 2018, p. 51). It focuses documentation on intended behaviours, not functional equipment, thus freeing the artwork from a fixed material-based identity. </p>

			<h3><b><em>Conserving Computer Based Art Initiative</em></b></h3>

			<p>The Guggenheim and New York University partnership project Conserving Computer Based Art Initiative (CCBA) focuses on source code analysis as a hybrid of material list and author intentionality. The approach places an initial emphasis on component level data collection to identify any high-risk elements such as dedicated or obsolete hardware, whilst encouraging a cross-disciplinary approach with conservators and computer scientists to determine intended functionality and artistic styles through ‘reading’ the source code (Engel & Wharton 2014; Engel & Wharton 2015; Solomon R. Guggenheim n.d. b). The CCBA approach was used in the reactivation of Shu Lea Cheang’s Internet-based artwork <em>Brandon</em> (1998–1999) which saw each line of the work’s source code documented, considered, and rebuilt using updated online standards that closely replicated the artists’ original programming style (Engel et al. 2018). The CCBA champions a collaborative approach across areas of specialisation, information technology and conservation, to tackle the complex problems of computer-based art, which often include networked connections.</p>

			<p>These initiatives demonstrate flexible documentation strategies for time-based media that provide two broadly distinct documentation approaches. The VMN’s main strategy is behavioural; it focuses on the conceptual by encouraging artists to consider the meta-level essence of their works and consider alternatives to functional components. By contrast, the CCBA has a greater focus on components; its production of detailed materials lists, including comprehensive source code analysis that provides insight into the materiality of the artwork. It is through this analysis that the CCBA understands the conceptual elements of the work. In both cases, there is an understanding of the importance of both aspects of the documentation approaches.</p>

			<h3><b><em>Dead state: problems with Documentation </em></b></h3>

			<p>Bosma (2011) raises concerns around an over-reliance on documentation as a sound preservation strategy for Internet-based art. Arguing that, documentation creates a ‘dead state’ that diminishes the work’s generative and processual identity (Bosma 2011, p. 18). Bosma’s (2011) approach to preservation, therefore, is to keep Internet-based art ‘running’ by maintaining the work online. As well as being costly, time-consuming and highly technical, this decision also requires careful consideration of the cultural context that the work sits within as the ‘strategies need to interpret the potential of the hive’ (Bosma 2011, p. 19). Online culture is not static or fixed, it changes with the progression of technology and time. If works are to be accessed and preserved into the future, aspects of the Internet that don’t fall strictly into ‘the work’ need to be considered and maintained. Otherwise, the ‘essence’ of the work is increasingly at risk of becoming lost.</p>

			<p>This itself opens problems concerning decision-making and approaches. Is the online work to be considered contemporaneously and as such maintained with updates that shift with the vagaries of the online cultural context? For instance, Marc Lee’s <a href='http://marclee.io/tvbot/' target=blank><em>TV Bot</em></a>’s (Versions 1, 2, and 3), which were maintained by the artist with updated versions to keep pace with changing habits of online news consumption. Alternatively, does the work act as historic statement, maintained with time specifics: a time capsule of a very specific online period? It should be noted that Lee’s previous versions of TV Bot still exist as video documentation to be displayed alongside the current version when accessed in a gallery setting (Gassert 2013). This offers the viewer an understanding of the progress of the steady intrusion of readily available news into our daily lives. There is, of course, no easy or definitive answer to these questions. The specifics of each Internet-based art preservation approach must be considered on a case-by-case basis, responding to the defining aspects of the individual work. As is the case, albeit more broadly, with the ‘bespoke ethics’ approach as argued for by Ashley-Smith (2017) and Wharton (2018) to avoid the ‘bland inaction’ (Ashley-Smith 2017, p. 7) of too prescriptive a preservation framework and instead allow for ‘innovating at the bench’ (Wharton 2018, p. 60). </p>

			<h3><b>The importance of Documenting User Experience</b></h3>

			<p>The importance of user experience documentation has received some critical consideration (Muller 2010; Spreeuwenberg 2011; Jarosi 2014; Dekker and Falcao 2016; Giannachi 2019). Its increased representation in interactive and participatory art documentation initiatives could provide for a fuller and more rigorous preservation strategy. Not capturing end-user information has detrimental effects for future re-activations of artworks: for example the hardware choice implications of using a standard screen resolution in Martine Neddame’s artwork, <a href='http://mouchette.org/' target=blank><em>Mouchette</em></a> (1996) has resulted in the tiling of the background image when displayed on modern hardware. Further, the novelty or ubiquity of certain elements found in Alexei Shulgin’s exploration of HTML elements as artistic building blocks in <a href='http://www.c3.hu/collection/form/' target=blank><em>Form Art</em></a> (1997), and the broader rationale behind seemingly inconsequential elements, such as the preponderance of .gif collections in the late 1990s early 2000s (Lialina 2009b) are all intricately linked to user experience. Strategies that incorporate user-experience allow for documentation of the non-technical but equally important experiential elements of interactive artworks that are at risk of falling through the cracks if not properly documented.</p>

			<h3><b><em>Documenting Historic hardware User Experience: Traversals </em></b></h3>

			<p>Dene Grigar and Stuart Moulthrop’s Pathfinders is a preservation initiative from 2013-2014, which creates what they call ‘traversals’. Traversals create the ‘recording and documentation of interface and textual features’ on ‘historically appropriate platforms’ (Grigar & Moulthrop 2018, p. 351) for digital texts. The approach produces video recordings of authors and non-authors accessing and engaging with digital texts on hardware representative of the historic period of production. As part of the process users are asked to ‘vocalize their interactions’ (Grigor & Moulthrop 2018, p. 354), providing insight into their rational and decision-making. Due to the highly specific hardware and software requirements of many digital texts, the initiative aims to record both the author and non-author experience to ‘make available […] the experience of complex works of literary art involving highly various levels and forms of interactivity’ (Grigar & Moulthrop 2018, p. 352). The approach highlights the influence that historic hardware has on the realisation of works, including ‘the basic operation of the texts themselves and their relationship with encapsulating structures’ (Grigar & Moulthrop 2018, p. 355). It acknowledges that the creation of video documentation of user access limits the realisation to ‘one single node or path’ (Grigar & Moulthrop 2018, p. 358). This reduces the interactive user element to a non-interactive document. However, providing video documentation of the work on historic hardware allows researchers ‘to tease out unique characteristics that may be lost in migrated versions’ (Grigar & Moulthrop 2018, p. 358). </p>

			<h3><b><em>First-hand user generated experiential data: Documentary Collections </em></b></h3>

			<p>The Pathfinder initiative touches on, although does not specifically acknowledge, an important issue with interactive artworks. As described by Caitlin Jones and Lizzie Muller (2008), there is often a discrepancy between the ‘ideal’ realisation of an artwork and the ‘real’ experiences of the audience. That is, despite an artist’s intentions, the realised user-experience may produce a dramatically different experiential relation with the artwork. To combat this discrepancy, Jones and Muller (2008) created what they call ‘documentary collections’. This approach ‘[combines] an artist interview with extensive audience research, complemented by technical drawings, exhibition photographs, or textual descriptions, ideally documenting various versions and exhibitions of the work over time’ (Kwastek 2018, p. 139). Further developing their methodology, Jones and Muller utilised video-cued recall (VCR) where the ‘recipients are filmed during the interaction and subsequently asked to comment on their actions and perceptions’ (Kwastek 2018, p. 140). The aim of the methodology is to provide multiple first-hand user generated experiential data of the artwork, both visual and audio/narrative. The intended result generated a broader picture of user behaviour, the aspects of the work they engage with and how, as well as building an archive of iterations. Together, this can provide a pathway for future reactivations of the work. The documentary collections approach takes the salient points of the Pathfinders initiative – the creation of video documentation of interaction with a work and inserts it within the broader preservation methodological approach of the Variable Media Questionnaire (Kwastek 2018, p. 139). </p>

			<h3><b><em>Community-driven documentation and the user experience: Play it Again and the Popular Memory Archive</em></b></h3>

			<p>The Popular Memory Archive formed out of the Play it Again Project (2013-2014) aims to document and preserve Australian and New Zealand computer games from the 1980s. Similarities can be drawn between this project and the user-focused documentation initiatives outlined earlier, by highlighting the importance of the idiosyncratic responses to works by the individual user. Going further, it also recognises the importance communities play in the broader documentation and preservation process. As Helen Stuckey, Melanie Swalwell & Angela Ndalianis (2013) note: </p>

			<p><em>it was fan communities who, years ago, took the initiative to document and preserve retro games, long before there was any institutional discussion on the cultural value of video game (Stuckey, Swalwell & Ndalianis 20313, p. 219).</em></p>

			<p>The Play It Again Archive accepts the collaborative process of community-driven documentation processes by presenting an opportunity to ‘display the team’s research’ (Stuckey, Swalwell & Ndalianis 2013, p. 217). This important element of the project allows for the documented game to continue to live ‘as a dynamic form that continues to have a presence in game culture’ (Stuckey, Swalwell & Ndalianis 2013, p. 218). The aim of the project is to shift the focus from documenting early games solely from a technical viewpoint by recognising and incorporating the importance of ‘user and interaction’ (Stucky, Swalwell & Ndalianis 2013, p. 218). </p>

			<h3><b><em>Documenting the functional artwork: Dullaart-Sakrowski Method</em></b></h3>

			<p>At the core of the Dullaart-Sakrowski Method is recognising the need to document the functional artwork <em>and</em> how it is experienced. This reception-situational approach produces dual video recordings — the artwork as it is navigated by the user, and an over-the-shoulder view of the user in their ‘natural’ environment (Spreeuwenberg 2011, p. 4). The method attempts to capture a more intimate viewing experience of the end user interacting with the Internet-based art. By doing so, the intention is to create a richer, fuller picture of the artwork as intended to be executed. Like the previously mentioned initiatives, the Dullaart-Sakrowki Method’s focus is on documenting the individual’s experience of the work. The method sets out to capture some of the broader cultural aspects of Internet-based art, to capture ‘interaction <em>with</em> the artwork’ as opposed to ‘interaction <em>of</em> the artwork’ (Spreeuwenberg 2011, p. 7). </p> 

			<p>A method that documents how an artwork is rendered on a multitude of playback devices, alongside recording the behaviour and interactivity of the user allows for a richer understanding of the overall nature of the work to enter the archive. By focusing on the user and their devices, the Dullaart-Sakrowski Method moves beyond the Pathfinder initiative’s focus on a singular piece of period specific hardware. Instead, it attempts to create a picture of the broader context and behaviours of multiple users on multiple devices. In this way, it is similar to the VCR approach of Jones and Muller. However, the Dullaart-Sakrowski Method’s goal is ‘to move beyond [Internet-based art] as set of technical specifications or an interaction model’, and instead, ‘capture the reception of [Internet-based art] in an environment in which it was originally perceived’ (Spreeuwenberg 2011, p. 15). As such, it generates documentation that moves towards capturing an element of the broader socio-cultural nature of the Internet. This provides an entry point into possible re-activation and re-interpretation of works that may have undergone significant degradation due to the progress of the online environment — both technical and cultural. </p>

			<p>The final stage of the model is the creation of a number of video records which are uploaded to a server with an accompanying metadata form to attach to the video description. The method’s design allows open access to the form and encourages users to upload their own content, thus encouraging a broad community of users to contribute to the preservation and documentation process. Dullaart and Sakrowski suggest using YouTube due to its ease of accessibility, familiarity of design, and cheap storage and hosting solution (Spreeuwenberg 2011, p. 5). </p>

			<p>The use of a commercial platform poses potential issues regarding ownership and the possibility of video deletion (as exemplified by Cortright’s <em>VVebcam</em>). Dullaart and Sakrowski state, they still ‘make back-ups and keep [their] eyes open for other options’ (net.artdatabase n.d.). Suggesting that, a more open source and less commercial platform could be considered, but such an approach could have implications for widespread accessibility and the need for considerable server space. The possible hosting of videos on collecting institutions’ own servers provides greater security and control, but at the cost of wider community access and contribution. A possible solution could be built off the Play it Again initiative and engage with relevant communities, or the incorporation of the institution’s public programs encouraging community involvement (Stuckey & Swalwell 2014). Such an invitation aligns with the more community-driven museum practice identified by Susana Smith Baustista (2014) and Johanna K Taylor (2020) that sees museums and galleries moving towards community led direction and not the other way around. </p>

			<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

			<p>More than just a static entity existing on the web, Internet-based art is deeply embedded in the online behaviours, customs and traditions that are constantly emerging through user interaction and engagement. The increasingly fast paced advancement of both technological standards and user behaviours and norms makes preservation of Internet-based art a difficult process. As these works are processual and subject to frequent variability, a documentation approach that can allow re-activation, or re-interpretation provides an entry point into the artwork.</p>

			<p>Due to the expanded socio-cultural elements deeply entrenched in online culture, there is a need to document and preserve these factors just as much as source code, equipment lists and artist statements. By ensuring the user experience is captured as an instance of the activation of the artwork, documentation can provide contextual evidence of both the technological and broader cultural elements as they are received by the individual. By positioning the user as an active contributor to the activation and realisation of an Internet-based artwork, this expanded documentation approach can provide for a method towards understanding the broader online culture of the work. It also provides documentary evidence of how Internet-based artworks render on different hardware, how users interact with components, and which elements elicit responses. This is not to diminish or dismiss alternative initiatives created to document time-based media artworks, but instead, call for a greater understanding and expanded documentary approach that considers the end user of Internet-based art an essential element in its execution. The Internet is, after all, built around its own unique cultural norms. It would be remiss to omit how the user experience in the documentation and archiving of the work plays a role in its activation.</p>
