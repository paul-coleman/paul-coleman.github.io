		<h1>The <em>Keith Haring Mural</em>: Professional Codes of Practice in Light of Media Scrutiny</h1>

		<div class="content">

			<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
			<p><em>Keith Haring’s 1984 mural, known as the </em>Keith Haring Mural<em>, has been the subject of much debate in the early part of this decade. After seemingly been forgotten during the 1990s and early 2000s wide spread media attention about its future called into question the legitimacy of conservation professionals and their approach to modern and contemporary art works (Peniston-Bird 2016). This article examines two conservation treatments, Andrew Thorn’s in 1996 and Antonio Rava’s in 2013, and shows the materials, methodology and decision-making processes undertaken by the two conservators and how, despite wide-spread public pressure to repaint the mural, a more cautious conservation approach was taken that adhered to professional codes of practice in order to maintain the significance and integrity of Haring’s work.</em></p>
			<h3><b>The constituent materials of the Keith Haring Mural</b></h3>
			<p>The <em>Keith Haring Mural</em> in Collingwood, Australia, was painted by American artist Keith Haring (1958-1990) in one day on Tuesday 6th March 1984 at the then Collingwood Technical School during his 1984 visit to Australia. The mural is 7.4 m high by 11.5 m wide positioned on a rendered concrete wall on the eastern side of the Technical School site. The colour scheme is primarily yellow, green and red. The top half of the mural depicts a green computer headed caterpillar being ridden by humanoid figures. An ‘electric brain’ (Brearly 2012, p. 42) is depicted within the computer-head. The bottom half contains an array of red humanoid figures dancing. Their vibrancy is indicated by motion lines around the dancing figures.<br><br> The mural is painted over a rendered concrete wall that ‘had a number of damages’ (Thorn 1997, p. 1). A 2010 report by the Centre for Cultural Material Conservation (CCMC) states the render appears to be composed of ‘sand aggregate cement’ (CCMC 2010, p. 15) and it ‘varies in thickness from 20-25 mm at the bottom tapering to 12-15 mm at the top’ (Thorn 1997, p. 3). Over time areas of ‘delaminating/detachment’ have occurred, however, it is suggested by Thorn (1997) that the render had already began to detach before Haring begun work as evidenced by areas where ‘Haring painted into pre-existing losses’ (Thorn 1997, p. 14). On top of this rendered concrete is a background layer of yellow paint. A 2016 ABC documentary entitled <em>Keith Haring Uncovered</em> (Peniston-Bird 2016) indicates that the yellow background of the mural was painted by students of the technical school before Haring arrived, this is supported by Heritage Victoria Database’s entry on the mural stating the background was painted on the 5th March 1984 (Heritage Council Victoria, 2004). This background was then painted over by Keith Haring on the 6th March 1984 with commercially available acrylic and alkyd house paints (RBA Architects 2011). Analysis of the pigments undertaken by Andrew Thorn in 1997 reveal the yellow paint layer to be made up of ‘yellow oxide and titanium dioxide and quartz […] composed of a methyl-methacrylate and butyl acrylate copolymer’ (Thorn 1997, pp. 5-6). The red paint layer contains ‘organic red (identity unknown but forming a fine stain in the sample), yellow ochre, hematite (1 particle possibly associated with the yellow ochre), titanium dioxide, gypsum, and chalk (none of these three whites in abundance)’ (Thorn 1997, p. 5). Thorn suggests the presence of an alkyd resin binder due to the ‘embrittlement and the cracking of the red’ (Thorn 1997, p. 5). Antonio Rava notes that the paint may be of ‘Dulux brand’ (qtd in Hurlston 2013). The green paint layer contains ‘yellow oxide, green dyestuff (not thalocyanine) and titanium dioxide (not in abundance)’ (Thorn 1997, p. 6).</p>
			<h3><b>Treatment materials, rational and method</b></h3>
			<p>The <em>Keith Haring Mural</em> to date has undergone two conservation treatments. Andrew Thorn led the first treatment in 1996 whilst Antonio Rava led the most recent treatment in 2013.</p>
			<h3><b>Andrew Thorn - 1996</b></h3>
			<p>Thorn’s 1996 treatment found the mural to be in an ‘advanced state of degradation’ (Thorn 2010, p. 2) suffering a range of deterioration conditions including: ‘micro-spalling of the red paint areas, sheet detachment of the yellow background in sheets up to 200 mm in length, chalking of the yellow paint, rising moisture, graffiti and other human impact’ (Thorn 2010, p. 2). Thorn’s 1996 treatment introduced a number of materials in order to stabilise the mural.<br><br>Thorn’s treatment plan involved an initial cleaning of the surface of the painting in order to remove any staining that had accrued overtime. He undertook a solvent solubility test on different paint surfaces with increasing levels of polarity and found a ‘trend to greater solubility with increasing polarity’ (Thorn 1997, p.10). This indicated the paint surface was very sensitive to solvents and all further treatment involving solvents were ‘adjusted to accommodate this sensitivity’ (Thorn 1997, p. 10). The surface was cleaned with swabs dipped in <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cyclohexane" target="_blank">cyclohexane</a>, a solvent known to have low polarity (Hansen 2007), to remove initial stain deposits (Thorn 1997, p. 10). With the surface clean, Thorn began work on surface loss consolidation and paint consolidation.<br><br>Of particular concern was the advanced deterioration of the red paint layer, which showed evidence of severe detachment from the underlaying yellow paint layer. In order to reattach the red areas to the underlaying yellow, Thorn used an ‘an acrylic emulsion (Rohm and Haas AC 2235) comprised of an undisclosed ratio of methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate’ (Thorn 1997, p. 11). The decision to use the AC 2235 acrylic emulsion stemmed from Thorn’s discussion with commercial paint laboratories who advised on the similarity this solution had to existing exterior acrylic house paints, and would therefore be ‘very compatible with the yellow ground’ (Thorn 1997, p. 11). This consolidating acrylic emulsion was needed in order to stabilise the condition of the red paint as the alkyd resin present in the original red paint layer was incompatible with the yellow acryl background. As noted in a later study ‘the use of an alkyd resin over an acryl background caused serious adhesion and compatibility problems, and enhanced the micro-spalling and loss phenomena’ (La Nasa et al. 2016, p. 946). The consolidating emulsion was brushed onto the surface and the adhesive set with a heat gun. Silicone release paper was used as an intermediary to avoid disturbing the surface whilst pressure was applied to the heated area. (Thorn 1997, p. 11).<br><br>Due to rising damp large portions of render had detached from the lower portion of the wall. However, Thorn noted ‘in the majority of cases the paint surface remained well attached to the detaching render’ (Thorn 1997, p. 12). The losses from the wall render were consolidated with an ethyl silicate ‘to establish a sound surface’ chosen for its ‘good consolidation without changing the moisture permeability of the consolidated surface’ (Thorn 1997, p. 12). Larger areas of loss were in-filled with a grout comprised of ‘ethyl silicate formed into a stable gel with hydrophilic fumed silica, quartz flour, graded sands, colorants’ (Thorn 1997, p. 12). Finally, the detachments were injected with acrylic emulsion AC 2235. The benefits of the loss consolidation involved treating the surface with a hydrophobic solution to assist in the limitation of water damage, which had manifested as rising damp at the base of the mural. The ethyl silicate was chosen for its ‘gentle approach’ with the possibility of more ‘disruptive approaches’ (Thorn 1997, p. 12) should this method fail.<br><br>The faded appearance of the yellow paint layer was due to chalking of the surface. ‘Chalking is the appearance of a loosely adherent powder on a film resulting from the degradation of the binder’ (Horie 2010, p. 425). Thorn noted that ‘titanium and zinc oxides are known to accelerate chalking of acrylic and other synthetic resins’ (Thorn 2010, p. 4). Chalking scatters white light hitting the paint surface resulting in a faded appearance (CCMC 2010, p. 58). This chalking of the yellow colour was determined to be due to the presence of titanium dioxide in the paint layer reacting with the binding acrylic resin: ‘It has since been explained that a photocatalytic oxidation cycle takes place in the medium and that titanium dioxide is a strong catalyst for the reaction’ (Thorn 2000, p. 195). Evidence also suggests that this reaction’s occurrence is far more likely when the glass transition temperature of the binder is exceeded (Thorn 2000), as is the case of the unprotected, outdoor <em>Keith Haring Mural</em>. The photocatalytic oxidation reaction occurs when titanium dioxide present in the paint layer reacts in the presence of moisture and oxygen which transition into free radicals hydroxide (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO<sub>2</sub>). The CCMC notes the ‘free-radical associated reactions can be summarised into two main processes: a. Conversion of water and oxygen to damaging free radicals in the presence of titanium dioxide. b. Free radical induced changes to the binder’ (CCMC 2010, p. 25). Thorn’s approach to stop this degradation was to treat the surface of the wall with a waterproofing coating and apply a UV blocker in order to stop the chemical reaction of the titanium dioxide. Thorn, drawing upon previous work on rock art (Thorn 1995) and in porous artworks (Hosek & Sramek 1992), decided upon a hydrogen functional siloxane (Thorn 2000, p. 198) with the constituent materials being: ‘siloxane in petroleum spirit (8% w/w) […] applied by spray to the entire surface’ (Thorn 2000, p. 198). The use of the siloxane solution thus eliminated one of the catalysts of the photocatalytic oxidation reactions of the titanium dioxide. To further reduce the likelihood of the titanium dioxide reaction, an ‘acrylic resin with UV filter and radical scavenger’ (Thorn 1997, p. 14) coating was also applied. The modified resin consisting of Tinuvin 1130 and Tinuvin 292 was used to coat the surface of the painting in order to block UV while the radical scavenger would ‘absorb any free oxygen forming around the reaction sites’ (Thorn 1997, p. 14). Thorn’s hydrophobic and UV filter/radical scavenger treatment were intended to be reapplied every 5 years, however, after the 1996 application no further coatings were applied, thus the effectiveness of this treatment method cannot be commented on.<br><br>There was additionally an attempt to reintegrate losses of paint upon the surface of the painting. Thorn’s team felt the overall ‘understanding or readability’ (Thorn 1997, p. 14) of the mural was still intact and thus were against additional painting yet landed on a ‘compromise’ and ‘toned’ (Thorn 1997, p. 14) the surface with cadmium yellow to consolidate some colour loss and create an overall impression of matching the surrounding wall. This retouching quickly faded, turning into a pale grey. It has been noted (Thorn 2000; CCMC 2010) that although unknown in 1996, cadmium yellow is unstable in an outdoor environment and ‘fades significantly in areas of high moisture’ (CCMC 2010, p.18). However, this treatment did meet best practice at the time (CCMC 2010).</p>
			<h3><b>Antonio Rava - 2013</b></h3>
			<p>Antonio Rava’s 2013 conservation treatment found the mural in a considerable state of degradation. The surface was first cleaned using mechanical dry cleaning using ‘PVC free erasers (polyvinyl chloride)’ (Dickens et al. 2016, p. S2-34). This was done in order to remove the thick titanium dioxide alteration layers that had formed. This returned the yellow paint surface to a level close to the original vibrant colour. Again, like in 1996, much of the red paint had began cracking and flaking, Rava’s team used a ‘nano-phase acrylic emulsion’ for ‘re-cohesion’ and a 60°C heated spatula for re-adhesion and to ‘settle back the peeling fragments of paint’ (qtd in Hurlston 2013) for consolidation. To consolidate losses in the plaster, Rava’s team used this same nano acrylic emulsion ‘thickened with clean sand’ (qtd in Hurlston 2013) to fill in losses and to reattach the flaking areas of plaster. The edges were filled using Gesmonite ‘a reticular suitable for exterior exposure’ (qtd in Hurlston 2013)<br><br>During Rava's treatment the door piece, signed by Haring, which was stolen soon after completion, was returned. As the door had apparently been kept indoors for 30 or so years Rava's team used colorimetry to compare the difference in colour between the door and the outdoor, exposed mural. <br><br>With the mural stabilised, there was much public discussion over how best to move forward with the work, some camps calling for complete repainting to restore the work to its original vibrancy others suggesting a less drastic, conservation approach. The surface of the painting had deteriorated significantly since Thorn’s 1996 conservation treatment and the work was in danger of reaching a point of irreparable damage, however, the mural remains one of only a few of Haring’s public murals not to have undergone major restoration works and as such holds a major degree of significance as evidence of the ‘artist’s hand’. Ultimately a ‘transparent glaze’ (Dickens et al. 2016, p. 35) was applied to the red paint layer. This glaze was made of a nano-acrylic emulsion and ‘the same synthetic pigment as the original, from Kremer Pigments, Switzerland’ (qtd in Hurlston 2013). ‘This method ensured that it is still possible to see Haring’s technique close up. But from a distance his lines have returned to their original vibrancy’ (Dickens et al. 2016, p. 36). Andrew Thorn (2010 p. 5) and the CCMC (2010) both suggested the use of a transparent glaze as the least invasive treatment for the mural as ‘the acrylic micro-emulsion can be easily reversed mechanically using an eraser, leaving Haring’s original red paint untouched under-neath’ (Dickens et al. 2016, p. 35). The red transparent glaze acts as a stain that does not soak into the surface of the wall thus making it a much more reversible option than repainting, as will be discussed below</p>
			<h3><b>Community backlash and context informing decision-making</b></h3>
			<p>Questions of treatment methodology created tensions between community groups and conservators. The RBA Architects report sums up the opposing views by contrasting quotes, first from Chris McAullife, director of the Ian Potter Museum of Art (qtd in RBA Architects 2011, p. 15):
				<blockquote>I would endorse the repainting of the mural on the basis of principles and processes established by the Haring estate, in order to re-boot it as a vibrant and highly visible part of Melbourne’s mural and street art history.</blockquote>
			By contrast, conservator Andrew Thorn of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) (qtd in RBA Architects 2011, p. 15) is quoted:
				<blockquote>We are very concerned that the idea of overpainting the mural is still being considered. We see such an approach as destroying the integrity of an original and nationally significant artwork.</blockquote>
			The main tension between the two camps stems from questions of artistic intent, authenticity, and conservators’ professional codes of ethics, all of which play a key role in decision making in the treatment process. In support of restoring/repainting the Mural, the pro-repainting group refer to a 14th October 2010 letter from the Keith Haring Foundation partially quoted here: ‘the Collingwood mural should have been better understood and cared for since its inception. Other communities have undertaken this care through the restoration of their own Haring murals, choosing to return the murals as Keith originally intended and gifted them’ (qtd in RBA Architects 2011, pp. 19-20). Much support for repainting the mural stemmed from the strong favour for repainting given by the Keith Haring Foundation (Mathews, H 2011; RBA Architects 2011). It should be noted that while many proponents for repainting indicate the Keith Haring Foundation’s support for repainting public murals, the author of this paper could not find any primary evidence to support this assertion. Likewise, the CCMC 2010 report on the Keith Haring Mural also indicates not being able to identify any written evidence of this nature: ‘CCMC has not sighted a written statement by the Keith Haring Foundation to that effect in any of their literature nor published materials’ (CCMC 2010, p. 56).<br><br>However, the mural’s heritage status (Victorian Heritage Register H2055) gives the work legal protection, requiring permission before any works are carried out. The National Trust indicates an awareness of the Keith Haring Foundation’s recommendation of painting and ‘replication by artisans’ but sides with ‘experts in paint technology, conservators and heritage groups’ (National Trust 2008) who are concerned that any repainting over the existing paint surface will irreparably damage the mural. Research into the behaviour of acrylic paints indicate acrylic polymers coalesce creating a ‘continuous surface’ that is filled with ‘pores or micro-voids’ (Jablonski et al. 2004, p 5). Due to these issues, the CCMC concludes ‘applying a coherent, uniform film of new paint (presumably acrylic resin) over the fragmented, porous layer of the original will impregnate and form a solid matrix with the original paint. The overpaint layer will become intimately merged with the original’ (CCMC 2010, p. 35). The conservators’ concern with overpainting is the likelihood that the new layer will merge with the original layer making it impossible to discern and seperate original work from retouched conservation work. This will be in contravention of the AICCM Code of Ethics Article 35 which states:
				<blockquote>Any integration of losses should be documented in treatment records and reports and should be detectable by common examination methods. Such integration should be removable; not detrimental to the cultural property; and should not modify the known aesthetic, conceptual, and physical characteristics of the cultural property, especially by removing or obscuring original material.<br>
				(AICCM, 2002)</blockquote>
			The CCMC further warn that ‘it is predicted that over time, the inevitable movement and deterioration of the overpaint layer, due to its expansion and contraction in response to fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature, will cause the paint to detach, taking with it the original layer. The overpaint layer may therefore contribute to the further deterioration/destruction of the original’ (CCMC 2010, p. 35) and that ‘the new layer will be more “plastic” and liable to flex, expand and contract in the uncontrolled outdoor environment. The continuous movement of the new paint will impose stresses on the original paint fragments below and is likely to cause delaminating of the original paint layer’ (CCMC 2010, p. 38). This phenomena is explained by Stringer and Pratt (1993) where they demonstrate cracking on the surface of acrylic paint due to differences in moisture content between the inner and outer layers of thickly applied medium. As such the National Trust conclude: ‘The National Trust supports the preservation of as much of the original mural as possible using best international practice and relying on the advice of recognised experts in paint technology and historic preservation practice’ (National Trust 2012). For these reasons, it is clear despite public calls for repainting, Rava’s treatment followed professional standards while finding a compromise in the application of the transparent glaze.</p>
			<h3><b>Conclusions: lessons from the decision making process of the <em>Keith Haring Mural</em> and how they may be applied in future treatment decision-making</b></h3>
			<p>Both the 1996 and the 2013 treatments of the <em>Keith Haring Mural</em>, show a number of key factors in the decision-making process. Most notably, at all times both Thorn and Rava’s treatments maintained an ethos in line with professional codes of practice (Australia ICOMOS 2013; AICCM 2002) and always strived for full documentation and retreatability. Tests over solvent polarity dictated the use of cyclohexane, the application of ethyl silicate to treat moisture intake was used instead of more drastic intervention. These interventions indicate a cautious, minimal approach in order to do the least intervention necessary. As shown, much of the decision-making for Rava’s treatment was a delicate battle between public expectations and professional codes of practice. Ultimately, the application of the thin glaze to restore the vibrancy of the red in the mural was made to the satisfaction of both sides of the conversation. The mural was restored to its vibrancy when viewed from a distance, yet still allows the original artistic line work to be visible at closer inspection. Most importantly, the treatment will not cause irreparable damage to the mural and is reversible, thus satisfying the requirements of professional codes of practice. The treatments required innovative approaches that have lead to further understanding of behaviours of modern paint mediums, especially in regards to acrylic emulsions used in outdoor settings. Of particular interest is the evident incompatibility of the behaviour of alkyd resins used over acrylic and the use of an acrylic emulsion to consolidate and re-adhere the detaching paint film. This makes the Keith Haring Mural an interesting case study on the behaviour of modern acrylic paint mediums. Advances in research between the two treatments, also led to greater information regarding the use of cadmium yellow, and its unsuitability for outdoor use and the photocatalytic oxidation reaction caused by the presence of titanium dioxide. Furthermore, Dickens et al. (2016) have used the Haring Mural as an example of the conservation profession’s need to integrate itself more into the public conversation around the cultural heritage sector in order to be better understood by the wider public. While the issue of conservation public relations is outside of the scope of the current essay, the widespread negative media attention brought upon the conservation field highlighted the profession’s failures to communicate its core ethos and to be understood by a wider public audience (Jones, H 2002; Dickens, J et. al 2016). Overall the conservation treatments of the Haring Mural appear to have followed best practice and show how community engagement is essential, yet professional codes of practice must still always be followed.</p>
