		<h1>Putting the ‘Culture’ in Cultural Materials: Cultural Relativity and its Implications in the Cultural Heritage Profession</h1>

		<div class="content">

			<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
			<p><em>The conservation profession has shifted its focus from a scientific rationalisation of stable fixed cultural value embedded in materiality towards a more culturally engaged fluid model. This paper discusses the theoretical background underpinning this shift which necessitates a re-framing of cultural material as temporal agent that shifts meaning through time and contexts. This shift raises questions around authenticity that are consolidated by considering cultural identity in the Deleuzian term of a simulacra. By having no authentic original to refer itself we reject classical ideas of authenticity in favour of authentic alliances which place responsibility on the conservator to properly engage with the cultural components of the cultural heritage field.</em></p>
			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
			<p>The cultural heritage field has traditionally had a materialistic objective at its core (Brommelle 1956; Clavir 1998). It placed the physical integrity of the cultural object as its <em>raison d’être</em> in an attempt to approach some scientific truth; a ‘truth enforcement operation’ to use Muñoz Viñas’s terminology (Muñoz Viñas 2005, p. 91). However, at the heart of culture is people. People that represent an ever changing multiplicity of diverse, often conflicting ideas of cultural identity. As such, there has been a shift in the way conservation approaches cultural heritage. It is a shift towards placing a higher importance on the underlying cultural values that give meaning to cultural objects. This shifting position regarding materiality and cultural identity is not without its problems however, as it raises serious questions around authenticity, namely what is the authentic object if cultural value is relative? By way of approaching concerns around authenticity we must first understand how cultural identity operates under this new paradigm of understanding. This will allow us to break down the Eurocentric nature of cultural identity in favour of a more fluid and culturally diverse philosophy. This breakdown of cultural identity will require a reframing of cultural material as a temporal agent. This will remove the object from a fixed origin or genesis to which its identity can be referred. This will enable us to reject classical notions of authenticity in favour of an allographic understanding that emphasis interconnected points of reference creating a framework of authenticity-properties that allow the fluidity of diverse cultural identities.</p>
			<h3><b>Rejecting Fixed Identities</b></h3>
			<p>The <em>ICOMOS Nara Document on Authenticity’s</em> (1994) definition of authenticity ungrounds cultural identity from a fixed, privileged position of authority. Instead it creates a definition that accepts a de-centred cultural relativity:<br>

			<blockquote>All judgements about values attributed to cultural properties as well as the credibility of related information sources may differ from culture to culture, and even within the same culture. It is thus not possible to base judgements of values and authenticity within fixed criteria. On the contrary, the respect due to all cultures requires that heritage properties must be considered and judged within the cultural contexts to which they belong.<br>
			(Article 11)</blockquote><br>

			The <em>Nara Document</em> links cultural identity to both the tangible and intangible which is further outlined in the <em>UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage</em> (2003) which acknowledges the importance intangible cultural heritage has on the identity and continuation of cultural identity. These landmark documents set forth an understanding of cultural heritage that move beyond the materiality of an object of significance and open the conceptual space to consider aspects of cultural identity that fall outside of a standard Eurocentric model.<br>

			Recent writing in the conservation sector has addressed this shift in the fundamental approach taken towards materials and the cultural values they hold (Avarami, Mason & de la Torre, 2000, Clavir 2002; Dekker 2018; Scott 2015; Sloggett 2009). Marcelle Scott (2015) argues a paradigm shift has occurred within the conservation field. A paradigm shift represents a fundamental change in how the world is viewed. ‘They are the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity of normal science’ (Kuhn 1970, p. 6). Originally, conservation professionalised itself by opposing itself to the craft-person restorer instead moving towards an evidence based science model (Scott, 2015: Clavir, 2002: Hölling 2017). This new professionalised conservation came complete with concrete truths and rigid definitions for the conservator to rely on, a ‘normal science’ to use Kuhnsian terminology. The basis of this position saw cultural objects as fixed in their meaning and value that dislocated them from their position within a cultural sphere. This scientific empiricism, of course, lacked an understanding of the cultural impetus the defines much of the culturally significant. Clavir notes that: ‘Many First Nations, […] view the preservation of the cultural significance of a heritage object as inseparable from the preservation of traditions, oral history, community, and identity as First Nations; <em>preservation is about people</em>, and objects have their role in cultural preservation [italics my own]’ (2002, xvii). While focused on First Nations, Clavir’s argument can be applied to the broader field of cultural heritage as a whole. She shifts the focus into the ‘cultural’ of cultural heritage thereby reframing the focus on the underlying values that give the object its cultural significance. She notes previous conservation focus on an object’s physical integrity fixes the object’s meaning in time. This fixed, unchanging value robs objects, and the traditional custodians of these objects, of their agency and evolving identity.<br>

			<blockquote>The value placed on preserving objects from the past as discrete pieces of evidence also involves a belief in the ‘authentic moment’ in a culture’s history. Freezing a culture’s history at one moment in time in museum displays, the ‘ethnographic present’ (as it has been termed in anthropology) creates an understanding of indigenous cultures’ history as being important only within a constructed, fixed period in the past.<br>
			(Clavir 2002, p. 32)</blockquote><br>

	 		This focus on scientific rationalism sees cultures and objects as static entities that cannot change meaning over time. For the conservator this allows an easy answer to questions of authentic representation as it implies the possibility of returning an object to its true, authentic nature and thus creating the ability of representing a culture fully and truthfully within the safe confines of a Eurocentric model of the world. Hölling writes: ‘The ability to gain objective knowledge through scientific analysis led to notions of authenticity prefigured around “original object” and “original condition”’( 2017, p. 90). This notion of scientific rationality to return an object to some original condition, Lownethal argues, fetishises the object creating a priority that ‘flies in the face both of physical mortality and of alternative norms’ (Lownethal 2000, p. 21). The object becomes stuck in meaning and place, a fetish. But, as we will see this ‘original object’ and ‘original condition’ cannot be met.</p>

	 		<h3><b>Towards an Acceptance of Cultural Relativity</b></h3>
	 		<p>	Returning back to the paradigm shift mentioned earlier, the conservation profession is experiencing the opening up of the closed rationalism of conservation past and, following other fields of science, shifting towards the acceptance of experiential evidence from non-professionals. Scott writes: ‘recently many professions, including conservation, have realised the benefits of decentralising their knowledge base and are finding new ways of serving society by working directly with communities’ (2015, pp. 3-4). This shift towards a decentralised methodology sees experiential evidence becoming used in the decision making process. Clavir writes: ‘recognition of the value of experiential as well as scientific evidence represents a questioning of science as sole authority’ (2002, p. xxi). This shift in thinking can be seen as the acceptance of the postmodern rejection of meta-narratives in favour of notions of a multiplicity of authorship. Underlying this notion is the idea that the meaning of an object is not some inherent value born into it. Instead the object’s meaning is the result of underlying interconnections of values that shift with changing political, social, and historic meanings over time. Thus, in the Getty Values and Heritage Conservation research report it is argued that: ‘conservation should be recognized as a bundle of highly politicized social processes, intertwined with myriad other economic, political, and cultural processes’ (Avrami, Mason & de la Torre, 2000, p. 6). That is, the work of conservation is not performed in a bubble divorced from the cultural sphere, but the conservator is making clear decisive decisions about the representation of cultural identity.</p>

	 		<h3><b>The Cultural Object as Temporal Agent: Three Points of View</b></h3>
	 		<p>	If then, the conservator is to understand the object as fundamentally existing as something that is changing over time in relation to its interaction within the cultural sphere it should be considered as an active and alive agent. The goal is not to return the object to some impossible Ideal Form, returning it to its genealogical point zero, but instead as managing its change through time. If we are to accept this position we need a radical rethinking of how the conservator conceptualises objects. To this end, recent scholarship has theorised a conceptual framework that frees the object from its static fixed position and instead places it within a temporal time frame that allows us to link it to its position within the cultural sphere. The common thread amongst all of these theories, as will be expanded upon below, is seeing cultural material stretched across time and place.<br>
			Hölling (2014; 2016) argues for an ontology of objects as relative to their temporal duration. She sees all works as enduring temporal performances operating relative to human life duration either on a slow scale (such as paintings and sculpture) or a fast scale (such as theatre and dance).‘Instead of arresting change, and situation conservation as an active actor in this impossible mission, we may think of artworks of all kinds as ever changing and evolving entities that continually undergo physical alteration and transition’ (Hölling 2016, p. 22). Hölling’s understanding of art as relative-duration performances takes the object out of the traditional framework of static object and allows for a more holistic approach to conservation that can allow for impermeability and change.Taking this temporality understanding a step further, LaTour and Lowe (2011) view works as having a trajectory or career that necessitates a constant re-production of itself. They break the ontology of the object from a single point in time in order to see the work as ‘always reproduced, that is, it is always a re-production of itself, even when it appears to stay exactly the same in the same place’ (LaTour & Lowe 2011, p. 284). By this, they mean the object is always re-producing itself in distinct temporal moments as its trajectory moves forward in points in time. They use this break in thinking to reframe the question of reproduction from original versus copy into differentiation of ‘good reproductions from the bad’ (LaTour & Lowe 2011, p. 284). Finally, Kemp (2009) argues for a conceptualisation of objects as software versioning where each conservation act creates a distinct and updated version. He creates a thought experiment around a three-pointed axis along which an object moves through time:<br>

			<blockquote>it can be reframed by hypothetically plotting a work at any given time between three temporal axes where each axis nominally describes variables emanating from the impossible-to-return-to ground zero of an object’s origin. The z-axis plots any significant change to an object’s function, the y-axis any change in how the object is interpreted, and the x-axis plots any change in original material.<br>
			(Kemp 2009, p. 64)</blockquote><br>

			Linking back to the discussion of an object’s relative meaning depending on cultural contexts, Kemp notes that when viewed at different times over an object’s history (trajectory, career, temporal performance) its location along the three-point axis will necessarily have shifted. LaTour and Lowe would agree, seeing the object as distinct re-productions of itself in distinct moments in time.<br>
			Central to these reconceptualisations is Nelson Goodman’s distinction between <em>autographic</em> and <em>allographic</em> works. In <em>Languages of Art</em> (1976) Goodman argues a work is autographic if its material history, that is who made it and how, is integral to the identity of the piece, whereas allographic works do not have this precondition and can be re-produced an infinite number of times without ever calling into question authenticity or originality. Accepting the temporal basis for objects creates a new world where: ‘<em>all</em> autographic works actually have an allographic component as when any one work is considered at two points in its history, each iteration’s qualities will necessarily be different to the other, yet each will still be considered as “the work”’ (Kemp, 2009, p. 65).This allographic classification necessitated by the allowance of cultural relativity raises tensions within traditional ideas of objects and authenticity by essentially eliminating the concept of an ‘original’ against which to refer itself. In Deleuzian thought this lack of an original to refer back to creates a simulacrum, a copy without an original. ‘The simulacrum is the instance which includes a difference within itself, such as (at last) two divergent series on which it plays, all resemblance abolished so that one can no longer point to the existence of an original and a copy’ (Deleuze 2004, p. 82). The simulacrum: ‘undermines the distinction between copy and original’ (Dekker 2018, p. 127).</p>

			<h3><b>Cultural Heritage as Simulacrum</b></h3>
			<p>	How then does the simulacrum operate in the cultural heritage sphere. Deleuze writes ‘for by simulacrum we should not understand a simple imitation but rather the act by which the very idea of a model or privileged position is challenged and overturned’ (Deleuze 2004, p. 82). In terms of cultural heritage, this Deleuzian model gives us a methodology that releases cultural identity from a dominant mode of thinking, that is, the idea of a model or privileged position, and places cultural identity along an axis of difference. Cultural identity is no longer <em>different from</em> but instead is <em>difference in itself</em>. Fundamental to this understanding is a rejection of the privileged position of the Eurocentric model against which we base all judgements of cultural value. This regressive mode of thinking is the foundation for the scientific rationalism that saw us viewing cultural identities as fixed and unchanging. Having identified cultural identity as a simulacrum necessarily muddies a concrete ground of ‘authenticity’ as we have no model to refer back to. As Hölling states: ‘“authentic” always requires a referent, an indexical dimension to relate to, as not all authentic objects are authentic in every respect’ (2017, p. 93). A solution to this crisis in authenticity is offered by Annett Dekker who proposes ‘authentic alliances’ to overcome the lack of the authentic original. Thinking of authenticity in terms of alliances reframes the question of authenticity from ‘<em>what</em> is authentic’ to ‘<em>where</em> authenticity is and what it <em>does</em>’ (Dekker 2018, p. 136). LaTour & Lowe offer a striking example of this questioning of authenticity. They argue the aura, what we can understand as ‘authenticity’, of Veronese’s <em>Nozze di Cana</em> (1562-1563) in the Louvre, Paris, jumps to the more culturally, contextually, and historically sensitive version that Factum Arte scanned and printed to return to its genesis in Palladio’s refectory at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, despite it not being the original historic artefact (LaTour & Lowe 2011). Their work offers an example of the original materiality, the physical painting no longer representing the authentic model against which to judge the copy; instead the alliance of authentic properties, that is, context, cultural value, and other modes of ‘authenticity’ are operating to form a new understanding of the ‘authentic’ work. From their example, a case can be made for authenticity belonging outside of the material object and instead existing in the realm of cultural interaction. Authenticity is no longer bound to the object-as-artefact but instead may be found in the alliances created by interconnecting cultural values and significance.</p>

			<h3><b>Conclusions</b></h3>
			<p>	As we have seen cultural heritage cannot be linked to a single static point in time. Cultural identity is a framework of interconnecting values that ebb and flow over time and across space, thereby refusing to be captured in a moment of identity formation. As Clavir notes: ‘Cultural significance is tied not only to the time period that created its original meaning, but to today, and the future’ (2009, p. 142). This has created tension for the conservator as to what the authentic object is. By reconceptualising objects in a temporal framework the conservator can free the object from its fixed static state and instead must now act in a more involved, culturally informed manner. The object, as active agent, has value input into it from a multiplicity of culturally diverse view points. This places a higher onus on the conservator to engage with and respect input from points-of-view outside of traditional Eurocentric positions of knowledge in order to attempt to capture the alliance of authenticity of the cultural within the material. This necessarily disrupts a solid state of identity which calls into question notions of authenticity and identity that the conservator must grapple with while acknowledging that there is no ideal point zero upon which the object can be returned to.</p><br>
